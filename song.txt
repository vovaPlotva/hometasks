You have forsaken all the love you've taken
Sleepin' on a razor there's nowhere left to fall
Your body's aching, every bone is breakin'
Nothin' seems to shake it, it just keeps holdin' on

Your soul is able, death is all you cradle
Sleepin' on the nails, there's nowhere left to fall
You have admired, what every man desires
Everyone is king when there's no one left to pawn

There is no peace here, war is never cheap dear
Love will never meet here, it just gets sold for parts
You cannot fight it, all the world denies it
Open up your eyelids, let your demons run

I thread the needle through, you beat the devil tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil's tattoo
